				<p>Hey! Im <b>INDIEWAVE</b>, an <i>indie</i> game developer with 5 years of experience building everything from experimental prototypes to fully-fledged interactive worlds.
					 My dream is to create games and experiences that leave players feeling just a little different than when they started---games
					 that stick with you emotionally.
				<p>I also work as a freelance 3D artist and video editor, supporting others and helping them develop their ideas & careers. There are many different projects
					that I have prioritised time into throughout many years and you can check them out <a
					href="#work">here</a>!</p>

				<h2 class="major">About</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/who.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>I'm an independent game developer--Polish by nationality, currently living in the UK. Game development was a hobby for me at first, but as I developed my skills over the years,
					I realised it was something that I wanted to pursue. I really enjoy the creative thinking that is a part of creating interactive experiences. I am currently in education
					and working towards qualifications in the game development sector.
				</p>
					<p>I also prioritise time to do freelance work (3D art/video editing) as I enjoy supporting other people and forming their own visions too! If this sounds like you, don't hesitiate to email me!</p>
					<p>Outside of the game development area, you'll probably find me in the gym frequently, playing chess, reading, and journalling.

					<b>DUNGEON DESCENT</b>
				</font>
				<p>This game was a title that I created with two other friends for the <a
					href="https://itch.io/jam/udc-jam-29">UDC GAMEJAM</a>. The jam was 1 week long, however we started 
					<i>4 days late.</i> I was responsible for developing the final game as well as creating some of the art and SFX.</p>

					<p>The people that I worked with developed both the art and soundtracks for the game as we thought these were elements that would make the
						experience much more polished. We worked well as a team and the overall result was praised its for its detail and gameplay.
						You can view and play the game <a href="https://indiewave.itch.io/dungeon-descent">here</a>!</p>

					<b>Orthographic Room</b>
				</font>
				<p>As a part of my college course, I created an orthographic room inspired by the title <i>Unpacking</i>. I made sure
				to conduct research based on the era that I have chosen for my room and create a result that reflected it. This was my first time
			using <b>3DSMAX</b> and I found the end result to be very polished.</p>

			<p>I also made sure that the topology for the room was of a professional standard as this is good practise for future projects.</p>
